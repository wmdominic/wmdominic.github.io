            <h3>Lesson Plan Writing Tips</h3>
            <a class="template" href="LESSONPLANTEMPLATE2020.pdf" style="color: blue;"><h4>Lesson Plan Template</h4></a>
            <a class="template" href="2010MNStateStandards.pdf" style="color: blue;"><h4>2010 Minnesota State Standards</h4></a>
            <h4>Writing Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The objectives you put on your lesson plan must be taught <em>within</em> the lesson. If it's not within your objective, you cannot assess it.</li>
                    <li>Objectives only state <em>new</em> skills/knowledge students will take away as a direct result of the lesson.</li>
                    <li>Keep the objective to a couple, assess and teach based and focused on those, and if there's something more than needs to be taught, a new lesson can be created to build upon the first.</li>
                    <li>Use Bloom's Taxonomy to write your objectives. The objectives must be <em>measurable!</em></li>
                    <li>When developing your objectives, ask yourself the following information:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the topic of the lesson?</li>
                            <li>What do I want students to learn?</li>
                            <li>What do I want them to understand and be able to do at the end of class?</li>
                            <li>What do I want them to take away from this particular lesson?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>When writing your objectives on the lesson plan, sort them from most important to least important. This will hep you for managing class time and accompishing the more important objectives. Consider the following questions:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are the most important concepts, ideas, or skills I want students to be able to grasp and apply?</li>
                            <li>Why are they importnat?</li>
                            <li>If I ran our of time, which ones could <em>not</em> be omited?</li>
                            <li>Conversely, which ones could I skip if I ran out of time?</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

            <h4>Writing Assessment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessment explains what kind of evidence is needed to mark the extent to which each student achieved each of the objectives you have listed.</li>
                    <li>Assessment is <em>not</em> the same as grading.</li>
                    <li>Assessments should reflect what you as the teacher would like to see come out of the lesson and refer to the objectives. The <b>outcome or result</b> of the lesson, not the <b>product</b></li>
                    <li>Formative Assessment should have four levels: <em>Exemplary, Proficient, Developing, Inadequate</em></li>
                    <li>Summative assessment would have standard letter grades or points.</li>
                    <li>Either way, you must explain clearly and directly the features you're looking for. What does a distinguished summary look like? What does it contain? How about a proficient summary? A Developing summary? Inadequate summary?</li>
                    <li>A great idea from a fellow classmate is to separate each objective in the assessment. Here is a an outline of how this would look:</li>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Objectives</dt>
                            <dd>Objective 1: </dd>
                            <dd>Objective 2: </dd>
                            <dt>Assessment</dt>
                            <dd><em>Exemplary:</em></dd>    
                                <div class="indent">    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Objective 1 Assessment: </li>
                                        <li>Objective 2 Assessment: </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                        </dl>
                    <li><em>Your lesson plan is concerned only with assessment of the stated objectives!!</em></li>
                    <li>Advice from Zoom Session with Kirchoff: <em>When writing your assessment, place the focus on the objective, rather than the student. For example, instead of saying, "An exemplary student will recall information about the Civil War by providing x, y, and z," you would write, "An exmplary recollection of information about the Civil War would provide x, y, and z."</em></li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Kirchoff's Additional Lesson Plan Tips</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>A lesson plan is not a play-by-play of the entire class period.</dt>
                    <dd>Do not include things like taking attendance, asking students questions about their weekend, and so on.The lesson plan details the lesson, not the class.</dd>
                    <dt>Create a realistic timeline.</dt>
                    <dd>Narrow your objectives to one or two you want students to learn. You have to make sure you solidly cover what you want the students to learn, not rush to get a bunch of things taught in one period.</dd>
                    <dt>Be prepared for confused students.</dt>
                    <dd>Have additional examples, alternative activites, or different resources for students so you are flexible and others can learn in a different way.</dd>
                    <dt>Write an estimated time for each step.</dt>
                    <dd>One tip for doing this is to estimate how much time it would take to actually do that step, then add a few additional minutes for some wiggle room. Be flexible and leave some extra time at the end of class too for any remaining questions.</dd>
                    <dt>Inform your students of your plan.</dt>
                    <dd>Keeping them in the loop will keep them engaged. You can write an agenda on the board or hand out an assignment sheet.</dd>
                    <dt>Reflect on your lesson plan.</dt>
                    <dd>Lessons don't always go to plan, sometimes they do. Reflecting on what worked and what did not will assist you in future lessons.</dd>
                    <dt>Link your lesson to State Standards.</dt>

            <h3>Writing Test Questions</h3>
                <p>The following information in this section on writing test questions was gathered from Milner, Milner, and Mitchell's <em>Bridging English</em>, p. 451-455, 6<sup>th</sup> edition, 2017. </p>
            <h3 style="color: rebeccapurple;">Selected Response (Objective)</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h5>Pros</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can be administered quickly and efficiently</li>
                            <li>Can be scored rapidly and reliably</li>
                            <li>Can cover an extensive body of content because they can be swiftly answered by the student and scored by the teacher</li>
                            <li>Can check reading or concept comprehension and leave class time for writing or discussion of larger issues</li>
                            <li>Can prepare students for taking other selected response standardized tests (esepecially multiple choice)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <h5>Cons</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are often constructed to test the most limited mental process--recall of facts.</li>
                            <li>Cause evaluation to rest on a single measure</li>
                            <li>Include only the most trivial content of learning</li>
                            <li>If timed, it tests speed rather than thoughtfulness</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            <h4>True/False</h4>
                <p>When writing True and False questions, there are a few guidelines you should follow to move beyond simple comprehension and retension questions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make statements unambiguously true or false.</li>
                        <li>Do not lift such statements directly from the expository texts (students will infer the importance of memorization).</li>
                        <li>Do not write trick statement.</li>
                        <li>Avoid the trivial.</li>
                        <li>Write statements that require higher cognitive processes than recal (for instance, comparison or synthesis).</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>A creative example from <em>Bridging English</em> states, "For instance, when assessing students' understanding of Fehrenheit 451, you might write a satement: 'Mildred deserves out pity.' Students must then decide whether this is true or false and explain their reasoning using examples from the text itself. This admittedly moves the true/false question away from the realm of the objective, but may serve as an interesting departure from the traditional essay" (453).</p>

            <h4>Matching</h4>
                <p>Teachers like this format because it "requires students to discover relationships or definitions; the teacher does not have to write plausible disractors; its copression of content allows students to take it quickly and cover a large amount of content" (453).</p>
                <p>The following are guidelines that should be followed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make matching items neither tricky nor simplistic.</li>
                        <li>Write both columns with clear and parallel structure.</li>
                        <li>Avoid lists with longer than ten entries, or students waste time sorting out responses.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>A helpful tip the authors suggest is to add more answers than there are questions. So if you have five vocab terms, you might have seven definitions. This way they don't simply choose what's left over (453).</p>
            
            <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>
                <p>"Well-written possible answers, called <em>distractors</em>, can engage students in a process of making finer distinctions than true/false or matching. Furthermore, if you analyze the distractors that are most seductive to students--that is, those that many mistakenly choose-- you have useful diagnostic information about students' confustions" (453).</p>

            <h3 style="color: red;">Discussion Questions and Responses</h3>
            <h4>Question:</h4>
                <p>If I want to teach a book that my school does not have or carry, can I request the school to order books for me? Or do I have to order my own books? For example, say I want to have a classroom set of Mary Oliver's A Poetry Handbook. Could I have my principal or the school order me a set? Or would I or could I buy my own set of 30 of them?</p>
                <p>Also, what if my school doesn't offer a book I'd want to implement into the curriculum? If they approve me teaching, let's say Copper Sun, but they didn't have that or enough books for my students, what could I do about it? Or would I have to teach something else? </p>
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p>Hi Will,</p>

                <p class="BlockP">Unfortunately, teachers cannot simply order sets of books they want to teach; schools can't afford that. When money is available for new books, teachers are notified by their principals. Then the teachers in a department (or a grade) will meet to determine (together) how to spend the money.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">However, schools usually have a storage room with numerous sets of books that may not be currently used. Before buying anything, you would check to see what's available. Copper Sun, for instance, is an older book, so the school might already own it.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Before adopting any new (or old) book, you would need to check with other teachers in your school to make sure that book is not already taught in another grade. As a new teacher especially, any time you want to make a change in the curriculum, it's a good idea to discuss it with teachers in your department.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Speaking of curriculum, depending on where you teach, the curriculum might already be set (you might be expected to teach specific books), and changing it requires a great deal of discussion and permission. For instance, at larger schools, there might be three 10th grade teachers, all of which teach the same book(s) and meet the same standards and objectives. A change in curriculum at such a school will require a great deal of discussion and agreement. On the other hand, in really small schools, you could be the entire English department. This comes with a bit more freedom but also a lot more preps.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">When schools approve specific books, but they don't own the title or have the money to buy it, teachers look for grant opportunities or partnership opportunities through the community. I know one teacher who partnered with (i.e. begged) a local business. She found a local company that was willing to buy the set of books, and then she had nameplates (sticky tags) made for each book with a special thank you to that company for their generosity. I know another teacher at a one to one school who worked with the public library. Her students had to open a library account and then they all had access to an electronic version of the book. (This needed approval from parents and principal.) In other words, teachers often resort to creative means to get the books they want.</p>
                    
                <p>Hope this helps. [Dr. Kirchoff]</p>

            <h4>Question:</h4>
                <p>I originally emailed Dr. Kirchoff about this question, which I have copy-and-pasted below. After having a conversation and some encouragement from Dr. Kirchoff, I wanted to share my question with you to see what ideas you all have as well.</p>

                <p>"So my teacher brain has been dusted off, the gears are oiled, and I'm running full steam... I have a question, and if you would rather me put this (and other questions like this) in the Q and A discussion board, I can instead. (And maybe we'll discuss this in class, but) how do we know how to pace a book for our classroom and/or units? For example, we're teaching Frankenstein to senior English, how do I know if what I'm assigning is too much or too little? I'm assuming you want your classes to be on the same page (if you'll pardon the pun). Like you don't want one class to be on chapter five and the other class on chapter fourteen. Is there a method to this? Or do you just have to figure that out year-by-year, depending on the group of students you have? Is there a way to calculate that grade six shouldn't be assigned more than a certain number of pages per night compared to seniors who could be assigned more?"</p>
            
                <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p class="BlockP">If teachers adopt a Nancie Atwell mode, this becomes a moot point, right? In reading workshop, students read at their own pace. Remember that Atwell assigns 30 minutes of reading per day. She assumes 7th graders will read around 20 pages in that amount of time.</p>
                <p class="BlockP">But of course many classrooms (most classrooms?) provide a shared reading experience for their students and they want students to keep pace with one another. That never happens though. Some students will finish the book ahead of time and others will fall behind.</p>
                <p class="BlockP">Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to answer your question, but you can do a "diagnostic" exercise to see where your students fall. For instance, you could do a timed read, without them knowing (because knowing would stress them out). Let them choose a book from your classroom library, give them 30 minutes in class to read it, and then see how many pages each person read. That would provide a rough idea. If you teach 5 sections of English 9, you can bet all 5 sections will provide a different average. [Dr. Kirchoff] </p>

            <h4>Question:</h4>
                <p>Hey folks,</p>

                <p>I have another question I wanted some opinions or resources or ideas from you all. Today in Grammars, we were going over very simple identification of subjects and verbs within a sentence. Professor Rowse stated that this can be troublesome for some students because of how the sentence is set up and how prepositional phrases sit in the sentence. I got to thinking... This is really basic for me, but even though it's obvious, I have to remember, students don't know these things (depending on grade level/learning level). I remember doing a project for Dr. Kirchoff a number of years ago where we had to write teeny-tiny lesson plans for middle school writing. I had the hardest time getting to those little bite-size lesson that students need. </p>
                    
                <p>So my question is: How do I know if I'm teaching too advanced/too much or if I'm teaching too novicely/too little?</p>

                <p>For example, I've never taught 7th grade English, so how do I know what's too much or not enough? Is this figured out by trial and error? Do we just review our standards and teach based solely off that if we're unsure what to teach? Does the district or school we work for provide us anything to work off of, like a list of required texts or specific topics we need to cover?</p>
                    
                <p>What are your thoughts, experiences, opinions, or resources? </p>
            
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p class="BlockP">Okay, since no-one is willing to offer their opinions, and I don't want Will to be left hanging, I'll offer some ideas.</p>

                <p class="BlockP">First, your school will likely have a set of goals for each grade (scope and sequence). When I taught high school, 9th graders worked on developing essays, 10th graders did a research paper, and so on.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Second, remember the impetus for that paper with all the mini writing lessons? You (and a team of teachers) read a set of student papers. Those papers were used as a diagnostic--a way for you to gauge what your students could do and what they needed to learn. Teachers do this kind of formative assessment all the time. It informs their teaching.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Third, the state standards also provide guidance. As you know, they are organized according to grade level.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Fourth, yes, there will be a set of texts for the grade you teach--and you will eventually find yourself fighting like hell to get them updated or replaced.</p>
                    
                <p class="BlockP">Hope this helps put your mind at ease a bit. [Dr. Kirchoff]</p>
