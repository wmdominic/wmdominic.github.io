                <h2>The following list are books and materials that I added to my personal reading,<br>as the topics and themes that appeared over the course of the semester<br>enticed me to do further reading and learning beyond the course. (Non-exhaustive)</h2>

            <dt>Materials on Education and Teaching Methods</dt>
            <dd>A majority of these books I found either by researching more work by theorists and resources found in <em>Beyond English</em> by Milner, et al. that I enjoyed or particularly favored in the assigned readings, or I found by finding more reading or materials on aspects or methods of teaching that I wanted to solidify or strengthen beyond the course.</dd>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Teaching When the World is on Fire</em> by Lisa Delpit</li>
                    <li><em>Grading Smarter, Not Harder</em> by Myron Dueck</li>

            <dt>Materials about or by Authors of Color</dt>
            <dd>The following books caught my interest as I came across them, as I found the reading of <em>All American Boys</em> and <em>The Poet X</em> to be extremely powerful and enjoyable.</dd>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The Water Dancer</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates</li>
                    <li><em>Stamped: Racism, antiracism, and you</em> by Jason Reynolds and Dr. Ibram X. Kendi</li>
                    <li><em>Four-Hundred Souls</em> by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi</li>
                    <li><em>Dear Martin</em> by Nic Stone</li>
                    <li><em>Black Girl, Call Home</em> by Jasmine Mans</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Materials on LGBTQ+</dt>
            <dd>This was list was brought on because I and another LGBTQ+ classmate were unimpressed with <em>Beyond Magenta</em> and how poorly it discussed and introduced pre-service teachers to trans issues and preparing them to have LGBTQ+ students in their classroom. We eventually stated our case to the professor to retire the book from the class. In the hope to finding something better, I did some searching for better LGBTQ+ literature that would be beneficial for not only pre-service teachers but within my own classroom library.</dd>
