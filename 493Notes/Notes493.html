                    "There is no one correct or proper version of the English language: There are many. Even the version we call American English has a wide variety of <em>dialects</em>. Different parts of the country, different levels of education, different ethnic backgrounds, different settlement histories--these factors produce differences in language communities. Every variety of English is equally grammatical--equally systematic, complex, logical, and expressive" (p. 4).

                                It's important to recognize that these internalized rules vary from one language community to another. (For example, plural "you." Some say 'you or you all' and others say 'y'all.)

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <h4>Most of the following is found in later Chapters.</h4>
            <h3>Inflectional Affixes</h3>
                <p>
                   Inflectional affixes are morphemes that are added to the open classes to change their grammatical rule in some way.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nouns have two inflectional affixes. (-s and -'s) (See <a href="#Chapter8">Nominals/Noun Phrase Functions - Chapter 8</a>)</li>
                        <li>Verbs have four inflectional affixes (-s, -ing, -en, -ed) (See <a href="#Chapter4">Verb Modification - Chapter 4)</a></li>
                        <li>Adjectives (and sometimes adverbs) have -er and -est. (See <a href="Chapter7">Adjectivals - Chapter 7)</a></li>
                    </ul>
                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Verb Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    A verb has three base forms (ex. to laugh):<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Base form (infinitive) [to laugh]</li>
                            <li style="margin-left: 25px;">Past tense [laughed] -ed</li>
                            <li style="margin-left: 25px;">Past participle [laughed] -en</li>
                            <li>-s form [laughs]</li>
                            <li>-ing form [laughing]</li>
                        </ul>
                    Base, past tense, and past participle are principle parts.<br>
                    There are two types of verbs: <b>Transitive</b> and <b>Intransitive</b> verbs.<br>
                    See <a href="#Chapter4">Chapter Four</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Noun Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Pronouns are considered nouns.<br>
                    A, an, and the are articles / determiners.<br>
                    Proper nouns, pronouns, and plurals don't have determiners.<br>
                    Objects are always nouns.<br>
                    An article is always a determiner but a determiner is not always an article.<br>
                    Indefinite articles (a/an)<br>
                    Definite article (the)<br>
                    <br>NP + VP = sentence<br>
                    Ex. He eats. I ran.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Adjectives and Adverbs Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Adjectives and adverbs can usually be recognized by their form and/or position in the sentences.<br>
                    Comparative and superlative forms (-er and -est) sometimes don't follow the inflectional endings. (i.e. more/most, less/least)<br>
                    Intensifier/Qualifier (very) <a href="#Qualifiers">See Chapter 13</a> for a list of Qualifiers and their uses.<br>
                    Adverbs are more moveable within a sentence, whereas adjectives are found near the item they are describing.<br>
                    Adverbs often end in -ly, but this is not an inflectional ending; it is derivational.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="adverbs">
                    <em>Adverbs supply information about time, place, manner, and frequency.<br>
                    Adverbs answer such questions as: <u>when</u>, <u>where</u>, <u>why</u>, <u>how</u>, and <u>how often</u>.*
                    </em> (These are also know as <b><em>Adverbials</em></b>.)<br>
                    <em>Adjectives answer questions like: <u>which one</u>, <u>what kind of</u>, and <u>what color</u>.</em> (These are also known as <em><b>Adjectivals</b></em>.)<br>
                    <br>*In language classes, when a word is underlined, we mean it as a word not as part of a sentence.

                    <dd>Direct object has a referent different than the subject, as indicated with the subscript II. Think of the the subject as the <em>doer</em> and the object as the <em>receiver</em>. Although this doesn't always work, so you may want to think of the DO as the answer to a <em>what?</em> or <em>whom?</em> question. <br>For example: The students organized (<em>what?</em>) a fundraiser.</dd>

                    <dd>The ADJ here acts as a subject complement. </dd>

                    <dd>The multiple NP<sub>I</sub>s in Pattern III indicate that the two noun phrases have the same referent. The <em>be</em> verb acts like an equal sign.</dd>

            <h2>Chapter 5: Changing Sentence Focus</h2>
            <h3 id="passivevoice">Passive Voice</h3>
                <dt>There are three indicators to determine a sentence is passive:</dt>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An object, usually the direct object, becomes the subject.</li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">A form of <em>be</em> is added as an auxiliary; it teams with the past participle, the <em>-en</em> form of the verb. In other words, we add <em>be</em> + <em>-en</em> to the active verb string.</li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">The original agent (subject), if mentioned, becomes the object of the preposition <em>by</em>. This third step is often missing; it is not required. Most passive sentences do not include the active agent.</li>
                    </ol>
                <dd>Ex (active): Ms. Franklin created the test.</dd>
                <dd>Ex (passive): The test was created by Ms. Franklin.</dd> 
                <dt>Changing Passive Voice to Active</dt>
                <dd>There are three steps that "undo" the three indicators above that make a sentence passive:</dd>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 40px">
                        <li>Identify the agent or true subject or "doer" of the verbal action. If the agent is named, you'll usually find it in a <em>by</em> prepositional phrase. If a <em>by</em> prepositional phrase or agent, just add "someone."</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px;">A surprise party is being set up by his wife. [Agent: his wife]</li>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px;">The homework should be finished by Tuesday. [Agent: someone]</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">Next, delete <em>be</em> + <em>-en</em> from the verb string.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px;">is being set up = pres + be + ing + <strike>be</strike> + <strike>-en</strike> + set up</li>
                                <li style="margin-top: 5px;">needs to be finished = past + shall + <strike>be</strike> + <strike>-en</strike> + finish</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">Rewrite the sentence with the agent in the subject position, the revised verb in place, and the passive subject shifted to the direct object slot.</li>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                    </ol>
                <h3 style="font-size: smaller;">Passive Voice or Active Voice?</h3>
                    <p>Passive voice is oftentimes seen as negative. This is due to passive sentences sometimes having a vague or unnatural quality, which can usually be improved by being changed to active voice. Though in most cases, this is because of a problem elsewhere in the sentence, not necessarily passive voice itself. The issue could lie in the fact that the focus of the sentence is off, which can cause the sentence to be in poor quality.</p>
                    <p>"<em>The main job of passive voice is to provide cohesion.</em> The passive voice enables the writer to shift emphasis in the sentence so that the reader will put the focus where it should be&#8212;on the new information" (93).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is also used when the "identity of the agent is obscured in history or simply has no bearing on the discussion" (93).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is common and encouraged in technical and scientific writing, legal documents, and lab reports, where the researcher is the agent. For example, "I added 10ml water to the solution every 10 minutes" is active but unnecessarily includes the researcher, so "Ten milliliters Water was added to the solution every 10 minutes" would be more appropriate but is passive.</p>
                    <p>Some cases of passive voice just are more direct than active. For example, "Joe was sent to Iraq" (94).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is used in "official-ese" or "bureaucrat-ese" to disguise or avoid the agent all together so the reader or audience does not know who is responsible. For example:<br> <br>"It was noted in today's expense reports that there will be budget cuts and some employees will be terminated. Severance packages have been established for those being let go. There are options to find a new position within the company."<br> <br>In this example, there is no agent mentioned. We don't know who "noted, cutting the budget, terminating employees, or established." This is often used when someone does not want to mention or reveal "who" was responsible for something.</p>
                <h3 id="theretransform">The <em>There</em> Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The <em>there transformation</em> provides the writer a way of changing sentence focus by altering the word order by opening the sentence with the unstressed <em>there</em>, known as an <em>expletive</em>.</p>
                    <p>The <em>there transformation</em> applies when the subject of the sentence is indefinite: "a book" or "an apple" rather than "the book" or "the apple."<br>The <em>indefinite article</em> is the signal that the subject of the <em>there transformation</em> is new information; we use the <em>definite article</em> for old or known information.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt style="margin-left: 45px;">There's a book on vegan baking on the shelf.</dt>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">When reading this sentence out loud, there is no stress on the "there" but rather there's stress on "book,"" as it is the focal point of the sentence.</dd>
                        <dt style="margin-left: 45px;">There's the book on vegan baking.</dt>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">This time, because the specific book is known, the stress is on "there" this time rather than "book".</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>The <em>expletive</em> form of there is <em>always unstressed</em>.</p>
                    <p>The <em>adverb</em> form of there, when opening a sentence, is <em>nearly always stressed</em>. This one acts like a pointer. "It's THAT specific thing."</p>
                <h3>Cleft Sentences</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Cleft Sentences</dt>
                        <dd>Allow writers to accomplish by means of word order what a speaker can do by varying the point of the main stress or loudness.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">SHARON gave a speech on Civil Rights on Friday. (It wasn't Jacob.)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Sharon gave a SPEECH on Civil Rights on Friday. (It wasn't a slideshow.)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Sharon gave a speech on CIVIL RIGHTS on Friday. (It wasn't on the Holocaust.)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Sharon gave a speech on Civil Right on FRIDAY. (Not on Thursday.)</dd>
                        <dd>Each of these show the stress that can be placed throughout the same sentence while speaking, though writing does not call for all-caps like this. This is where two types of clefts come in:</dd>
                        <dt style="margin-left: 90px;">It-cleft</dt>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">With it-clefts, you'll notice that the phrase following <em>was</em> is stressed, like the all-caps in the previous set of sentences do.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px;">It was <u>Sharon</u> who gave a speech on Civil Rights on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: -10px;">It was a <u>speech</u> that Sharon gave on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: -10px;">It was <u>Civil Rights</u> that Sharon gave a speech on, on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: -10px;">It was <u>Friday</u> Sharon gave a speech on Civil Rights.</dd>
                        <dt style="margin-left: 90px;">What-Cleft</dt>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">With what-clefts, a <em>what</em> clause is put in the subject position, and <em>was</em> separates the original sentence into two parts.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px;">What Sharon gave <u>was</u> a speech.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Sometimes <em>what</em> shifts the original verb phrase into subject position. Again, a form of <em>be</em> is added as the main verb.</dd>

            <h3>Modifiers of the Verb: Adverbials</h3>
            <h3>The Moveable Adverbials</h3>
                <p>In the following sentence, there are three underlines structures&ndash;an adverb, a prepositional phrase, and a clause&ndash;each of which add adverbial information to the verb <em>sang</em>:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang  <u>angelically</u>  <u>within the church sanctuary</u>  <u>when the organ began to play</u>.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>How?</em>) angelically.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>Where?</em>) within the church sanctuary.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>When?</em>) when the organ began to play.</p>
                <p>Even though all the adverbials in the prior sentence follow the verb, there is no fixed spot for most adverbials, which is why <em>moveability</em> is one of the most telling characteristics of Adverbials. For example:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the organ began to play, the choir boy sang angelically within the church sanctuary.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Within the church sanctuary, the choir boy sang angelically when the organ began to play.</p>
                <p>"The position may depend on the writer's emphasis, the rhythm of the sentence, its relation to the previous sentence, or simply on the desire for sentence variety" (109).</p>
            <h3>Adverbs</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Adverbs of Manner</dt>
                    <dd style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>-ly</em> words, such as lovely, angrily, sadly, and usually tell "how" or in "what manner." For example: She spoke softly   =   in a soft manner</dd>
                    <dd>Manner adverbs such as these are the most moveable adverbials, as they can appear before or after the verb or at the beginning or end of the sentence.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>Slowly</u>, the old lady ate her oatmeal.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">The old lady <u>slowly</u> ate her oatmeal.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">The old lady ate <u>slowly</u>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">The old lady ate her oatmeal <u>slowly</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>A single-word adverb can even come within the verb strong, between and auxiliary word and the main verb:</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The car was <u>immediately</u> turned over to the police as evidence.</dd>
                    <dd>Or between auxiliaries:</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I have <u>suddenly</u> been stuck with anxiety.</dd>
                    <dd>Furthermore, manner verbs can be marked by <em>qualifiers</em>, words such as <em>very, quite, so, rather</em>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I <u>very softly</u> walked through the house.</dd>
                    <dd>And like the adjectives they come from, these adverbs can be made comparative or superlative by adding <em>more</em> or <em>most</em>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Dr. Carollo reads his poetry out load <u>most articulately</u>.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>Single-word Adverbs</dt>
                    <dd>Besides the <em>-ly</em> adverbs, many other single-word adverbs provide information of time, place, frequency, and the like, including, but not limited to: <em>now, then, nowadays, today, often, always, sometimes, seldom, never, here, there, everywhere.</em></dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">You <u>seldom</u> do laundry during the week.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>Never</u> have I seen her <u>here</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>Some of these can be compared or qualified.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I ate <u>too fast</u>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>Quite often</u>, I oversleep on weekends.</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3 id="advprep">Prepositional Phrases</h3>
                <p>Prepositional phrases are one of the most common modifying structures, appearing regularly as noun and verb modifiers.</p>
                <p>Common prepositions include: <em>above, across, against, along, among, around, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, by, down, from, in, into, near, of, off, on, to, toward, under, upon, with</em> and <em>within</em>.</p>
                <p>Some prepositional phrases have modifiers that qualify or intensify them:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">James sat down <u>quickly</u> in his desk.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">Mr. White cried <u>softly</u> into his pillow.</p>
                <p>Sentences often have more than one adverbial prepositional phrase:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Santiago ran <u>to his mother's house</u>  <u>in the rain</u>  <u>on Sunday morning</u>.</p>
                <p>Like adverbs, adverbial prepositional phrases are rather moveable, but those referring to time tend to be more moveable than those referring to place, especially when found in the same sentence.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Around 9 AM</u>  <u>on Tuesday</u>,  the building caught on fire  <u>in the city</u>.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: -10px;"><u>In the city</u>,  the building caught on fire  <u>on Tuesday</u>  <u>around 9 AM</u>.</p>
                <p>Prepositional phrases can modify nouns as well as verbs, which can cause or <em>ambiguity</em>. For example:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">He is going to eat the the spaghetti on the floor. This can be understood as:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">He is going to eat the spaghetti that has fallen on the floor/eating it off the floor</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">He is going to eat his spaghetti dinner while sitting on the floor.</p>
            <h3>Nouns and Noun Phrases</h3>
                <p>"Nouns and noun phrases that function adverbially from a fairly short list designating time, place, manner, and quantity" (114). For example:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">He went <u>south</u>. (place)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">I ate breakfast <u>this morning</u>. (time)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Paul lifted <u>100 pounds</u> at the gym. (quantity)</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">She flew <u>first-class</u>. (manner)</p>
            <h3 id="verbphrases">Verb Phrases</h3>
                <p>"The most common form in an adverbial role is the <em>infinitive</em>" (117). This is the same as an <em>infinitive phrase</em>.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">Molly drove her car <u>to bring her sister to school</u>.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Wilson paid <u>to provide his little brother lunch</u>.</p>
                <p>As an added trick to see if the infinitive is working as a an adverbial verb phrase, replace the "to" in the infinitive phrase to "in order to." If this works, the infinitive is acting as an adverbial infinitive phrase.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">Molly drove her car <u><strong>in order to</strong> bring her sister to school</u>.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Wilson paid <u><strong>in order to</strong> provide his little brother lunch</u>.</p>
                <p><em>Dangling infinitives</em> occur when the subject of the sentence is no longer the subject of the adverbial infinitive phrase or is absent.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>To keep the employees happy</u>, good incentives are needed.</p>
                <p>This sentence does not have uncertain or unclear meaning, and the reader will not have difficulty understanding. But there is a sense of ambiguity that can be cleared up with the addition of the subject.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>A manager</u> need good incentives <u>to keep employees happy</u>.</p>
                <p>Sometimes <a href="#participles">participles and participle phrases</a> can have an adverbial function, providing information of time, place, reason, and manner, as other adverbials do:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">The couple fought <u>screaming at each other</u>.</p>
            <h3>Clauses</h3>
                <p>All sentences and <a href="#patterns">the patterns listed in Chapter 3</a> are considered clause, but not all clauses are sentences!</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Dependent Clause (Subordinate Clause)</dt>
                    <dd>Any clause that is not a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dt>Independent Clause (Main Clause)</dt>
                    <dd>Any clause that is a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>When the train came to a halt</u>,  <u>the tourists stumbled</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>"When the train came to a halt" is a dependent clause as it is an adverbial phrase.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px;">"The tourists stumbled" is an independent clause because it is a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dt>Complex Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>Any sentence that includes a dependent clause of any kind.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Because there's a chance for rain</u>,  <u>I packed rain boots and a jacket.</u></dd>
                    <dd>"Because there's a chance of rain" is a dependent clause as it begins with the subordinating conjunction, <em>because</em>.'</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px;">"I packed rain boots and a jacket" is an independent clause.</dd>
                    <dt>Compound Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>A sentence with two or more independent clauses.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Mark really enjoyed dinner</u>;  <u>he ate everything on his plate.</u></dd>
                    <dd>Both "Mark really enjoyed dinner" and "he ate everything on his plate," are independent clauses and can stand alone, but since they are connected with a semi-colon, this because a compound sentence.</dd>
                    <dt>Compound-Complex Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>A sentence with a dependent clause and more than one independent clause.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Since it was cold outside</u>,  <u>the dog slept next to the fireplace</u>,  <u>and the fire crackled through the night</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>"Since it was cold outside" is a dependent clause because it starts with a subordinating conjunction.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px;">"The dog slept next to the fireplace" and "the fire crackled through the night" are both independent clauses.</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>Punctuation of Adverbials</h3>
                <p>Some opening adverbials are set off by commas while some are not. The use of these commas tend to be stylistic choice, especially when it comes to phrases. Generally a short prepositional phrase or noun phrase or an adverb will not be set off:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">Quickly they all sprinted to the storm shelter.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -10px;">Around 7AM the birds began to chirp.</p>
                <p>With longer prepositional phrases, there is a choice:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">On sunday morning after church the family goes to brunch.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">At the elementary school during the flood, volunteers made lunches for the displaced and homeless.</p>
                <p>When the end of the adverbial slot is not readily apparent, the comma will help any misunderstanding:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">In the summer, nights come with a cool breeze.</p>
                <p>Verb phrases and clauses are <em>always</em> set off by commas:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">To become a teacher, I had to read many books for class and independently.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">To rollerskate, you have to have great balance.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">When the moon is out, wolves begin to howl.</p>
                <p>When an adverbial interrupts the verb phrase for special effective, it will be set off by commas:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">The telemarketer, annoyingly, called me twice during dinner.</p>
                <p>When the opening phrase is parenthetical, or clearly a comment on the whole sentence than a typical adverbial, then a comma is requested:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 90px;">"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly" (The Bee Movie, 2007).</p>

            <h3>Modifiers of the Noun: Adjectivals</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Headword</dt>
                    <dd>The word signaled by a determiner. This is a noun that is the main subject of the sentence. If a Noun Phrase is only one word, the headword <em>is</em> Noun Phrase. The following are examples of noun phrases and some of what can be added to them to modify the headword/noun. <em>These words that modify the headword/noun are called <strong>Nominals</strong></em>.</dd>
                    <dd style=" white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 90px;"><u>She</u> is sick.   (<em>She</em> is the noun phrase and the headword.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 90px;"><u>The gnome</u> sits next to the tulips.   (<em>The gnome</em> is the noun phrase; <em>The</em> is a determiner; <em>gnome</em> is the headword.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 90px;"><u>The really old woman</u> needed help across the street.   (<em>The really old woman</em> is the noun phrase; <em>The</em> is a determiner; <em>really old</em> is an adverb and adjective modifying the noun/headphrase; <em>woman</em> is the headword.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 90px;"><u>The photographs of her great-grandparents' wedding</u> were discolored with time.   (<em>The photographs of her great-grandparents' wedding</em> is the noun phrase; <em>the</em> is a determiner; <em>photographs</em> is the headword; <em>of her great-grandparents' wedding</em> is a adjectival prepositional phrase.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 90px;"><u>Randy's new Instagram account</u> has photos of his vacation to Hawaii.   (<em>Randy's new Instagram account</em> is the noun phrase; <em>Randy's</em> is a determiner; <em>new</em> is an adjective (noun modifier); <em>Instagram</em> is a noun modifier; <em>account</em> is the headword and subject of the sentence that's being modified by 'new' and 'Instagram'.)</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>The Determiner</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Determiner</dt>
                    <dd>A <em>determiner</em> is the word class that signals nouns. This category includes <em>articles, possessive nouns, possessive determiners, demonstrative determiners,</em> and <em>numbers</em>.</dd>
                    <dd>When you see one of these kinds of words, you can almost guarantee that it is beginning a noun phrase.</dd>
                    <dd>Some nouns, though, are not used with determiners, such as <em>proper nouns (George, Nancy), non-countable nouns (atoms, sand), abstract nouns (freedom, peace),</em> and sometimes <em>plural count nouns (bananas, kids)</em>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>This</u> pencil is yellow.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; margin-left: 90px;"><u>All her</u> cats sleep in the sun.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -10px; margin-left: 90px;"><u>Those</u> ducks are mean.</dd>

                    <dd>See <a href="#Noun_notes">Chapter Two - Noun Notes</a></dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>Adjectives and Nouns</h3>
                <p>When there are both an adjective and a noun modifying within a noun phrase, they must appear in that order (adjective <em>then</em> noun).</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 45px">We say, "Craig's new pool table is green," never, "Craig's pool new table is green."</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Adjectives as Noun Modifiers</dt>
                    <dd>The adjective slot of a sentence or noun phrase frequently has more than one adjective, all of which will modify the headword.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">My <u>smooth old bright green plastic</u> ball rolled into the street.   (All of the underlines words describe and modify <em>ball</em>.)</dd>
                    <dd>When there are more than one adjective next to each other, putting a comma in between them depends on the context. If the two adjectives can be separated by <em>and</em>, a comma should be added.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The <u>beautiful pink</u> rose.   (You wouldn't naturally say, "A beautiful and pink rose," so a comma is not necessary.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: -10px;">The <u>busy, lively</u> bees swarmed the patch of daisies.   (Here we can say, "The busy and lively bees swarmed the patch of daisies," so a comma is necessary.)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 140px;">Generally, when two adjectives are of the same class, they require a comma to separate them. "Beautiful" and "pink" are not similar adjectives, as one is abstract and one is a color. Whereas, "busy" and "lively" are describing physical behavior.</dd>
                    <dd>The adjective can be qualified or intensified.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">the <u>dangerously</u> yummy piece of pie     a <u>seriously</u> strong smell of coffee</dd>
                    <dt>Prenoun Participles</dt>
                    <dd><a href="#participles">Participles</a> can also be used as an adjective.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The <u>speeding</u> car ran the red light.</dd>
                    <dd>Because participles are verbs, they are also commonly modified by adverbs.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Her <u>loudly crying</u> child could not be consoled.</dd>
                    <dd>Sometimes we create a compound adjective by hyphenating to make it clear that the adverbial modifies the prenoun participle.</dd>
                    <dd>(The hyphen rule for this occasion is that the <em>-ly</em> (<em>slowly, peacefully,</em> etc.) do not take hyphens; other adverbs (<em>well, fast,</em> etc.) do take hyphens. (133)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">a <u>long-lasting</u> flavor</dd>
                    <dd>Hyphens are also needed when the first modifier applies to the second modifier and not the headword.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">My <u>part-time</u> job at the gas station.   Fargo had <u>record-breaking</u> snowfall last night.</dd>
                    <dd>Hyphens are also needed when a complete phrase is used in the adjective slot.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">That's just an <u>off-the-cuff</u> idea.</dd>
                    <dd>The book suggests that hyphens are not needed if the adjective phrase is at the end of the sentence unless its idiomatic "possibly". (133-4)</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The <u>back-to-back</u> interviews went well.   The interview are <u>back to back</u>.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her <u>middle-of-the-road</u> performance got 7.8 out of 10 from the judges.   She got 7.8 out of 10 from the judges, but her performance was <u>middle-of-the-road</u>.</dd>

                <h3>Prepositional Phrases</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Adjectival Prepositional Phrases</dt>
                        <dd>Modifies a noun and is formulated identically to <a href="#advprep">adverbial prepositional phrases</a>, like in Chapter 6.</dd>
                        <dd>These adjectival prepositional phrases describe the noun headword in relation to time, place, direction, purpose, origin, etc.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The relatively dim <em>lightbulb</em> <u>on the bedside lamp</u> looks like it's on its last legs.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;">I have always wanted that <em>house</em> <u>on the corner</u> <u>of Elm Street</u>.</dd>
                        <dd>Adjectival prepositional phrases assist in identifying a noun or pronoun by answering the questions: "Which one?" or "What kind of?"</dd>
                    </dl>
                <h3>Relative Clauses</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Relative Clause / Dependent Clause</dt>
                        <dd>The relative clause identifies the noun or pronoun it modifies and typically appears directly after that noun or pronoun.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The school <u>that was remodeled last summer</u> is holding a book fair next week.</dd>
                        <dd>A relative clause, with its subject-predicate structure, is a sentence pattern. The only difference is the noun is now a <strong><em>relative pronoun</em> (who, whose, whom, which, or that)</strong>.</dd>
                        <dd><em>Three features of a <strong>relative pronoun</strong> that will signify a relative clause:</em></dd>
                        <dd>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The relative pronoun renames the headword of the noun phrase in which it appears. (In the example above, "that" refers to "school.")</li>
                                <li style="margin-top: 10px;">The relative pronoun fills a sentence slot in its own clause. (In the example above, "that" is in the subject slot.)</li>
                                <li style="margin-top: 10px;">The relative pronoun introduces the clause, no matter what the slot it fills.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </dd>
                        <dd>All <em>relative pronouns</em>  fill slots in clauses that nouns normally fill. Though, some adjectival classes are introduced by <strong><em>relative adverbs</em></strong> <em>where, when,</em> and <em>why</em>.</dd>
                        <dd><em>Where</em> clauses modify the verb within its own clause, but really is adjectival towards the noun that precedes it. For example:</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">That's Sanjay's <em>house</em> <u>where the party was last week</u>.</dd>
                        <dd><em>When</em> clauses modify nouns of time.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I remember when grandma would tell me <em>stories</em> <u>when we would have dinner together</u>.</dd>
                        <dd><em>Why</em> clauses modify the noun <em>reason</em>.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I can't tell you the <em>reason</em> why they screamed and left the room.</dd>
                    </dl>
                <h3>Participle Phrases</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Participle Phrases</dt>
                        <dd style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the previous section with relative clauses, we could have a phrase like:   the kitten <u>that plays with the yarn</u></dd>
                        <dd style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We can change this by adding <em>be</em> + <em>-ing</em>:   the kitten <u>that is playing with the yarn</u></dd>
                        <dd style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This phrase can be reduced to:   the kitten <u>playing with the yarn</u>   This phrase, which is more or less a reduced relative/dependent clause, is an <strong><em>adjectival participle phrase</em>.</strong></dd>
                        <dd>This noun phrase, with its participle phrase as a modifier, will fit any nominal slot.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">My favorite is <u>the kitten playing with the yarn</u>. (direct object)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>The kitten playing with the yarn</u> is rambunctious. (subject)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">I like to play with <u>the kitten playing with the yarn</u>. (object of the preposition)</dd>
                        <dd><em>Three key features that will assist with <strong>participle phrases</strong></em>:</dd>
                        <dd>The previous example is a <en>present participle</en>, as it uses the <em>-ing</em> form of the verb in the participle phrase.As well, the present participle phrases are <em>active</em> because of the <em>-ing</em> form.</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <ol style="margin-top: -15px;">
                                <li>Verbs from all four classes (be, linking, intransitive, transitive) can function as participles.</li>
                                <li>The noun phrases in all NP slots can include participles or participle phrases as modifiers.</li>
                                <li>The noun that the participle modifies is its subject. In other words, the relationship between the headword of the noun of the noun phrase in which the participle is embedded and the participle itself is a subject-verb relationship.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Passive Participles</dt>
                        <dd>Another common form of the adjectival participle is in the <em>-en</em> form. This form, normally called the <em>past participle</em>, is more accurately called the <strong><em>passive participle</em></strong>.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The portraits <u>painted by my grandpa in high school</u> are in a local museum.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The apples <u>being eaten by the kids</u> are extremely red.</dd>
                        <dd>Like the <en>-ing</en> participles, the <em>-en</em> participles are also reduced clauses.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The portraits <u>that were painted by my grandpa in high school</u> are in a local museum.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The apples <u>that are being eaten by the kids</u> are extremely red.</dd>
                        <dd>Refer to <a href="#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a> for passive and active sentences and what makes a sentence or verb passive.</dd>
                        <dt>Moveable Participles</dt>
                        <dd>Although we often see the participle or participle phrase <em>after</em> the headnoun (in the postheadnoun slot), participles can be moved to the beginning of the sentence when modifying</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>Running the assembly</u>, the principal struggled keeping the students' attention.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;"><u>Born in 1922</u>, Betty White is known as the Queen of Television.</dd>
                        <dd>The participle phrase that modifies the subject can also be shifted to the end of the sentence.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The shelf had way too many books on it, <u>causing it to fall over</u>.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The boat swayed in the water, <u>riding the waves as they came</u>.</dd>
                        <dd>By putting the participle phrase at the beginning or end of the sentence, the participle phrase gets special emphasis. These are known as <strong><em>free modifiers</em></strong>. Though it is important to remember that they will always have a clear connection to its subject.
                        <dt>Participle as an Object Complement</dt>
                        <dd>In <a href="#Chapter3">Chapter 3</a>, there are two functions for adjectivals: subject complement in Patterns II and IV and the object complement in Pattern IX.</dd>
                        <dd>Sometimes this adjectival slot is filled by an adjective like: The guard does not seem <u>pleasant</u>.</dd>
                        <dd>Sometimes the adjectival slot is filled with a prepositional phrase: The guard was <u>at his post</u> all morning.</dd>
                        <dd>Also, we could use prepositional phrases as object complements: I consider your smile <u>among the best I've ever seen</u>.</dd>
                        <dd>For participles, there can be an extremely subtle difference between the participle as a direct object or an object complement:</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The mechanic found the <u>broken</u> bolt.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;">The mechanic found the bold <u>broken</u>.</dd>
                        <dd>To determine if the participle part of the direct object or an object complement, substitute for pronouns:</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The mechanic found it.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;">The mechanic found it broken.</dd>
                        <dd>Another way to determine if the sentence has an object complement is to insert <em>to be</em>:</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">The mechanic found the <em>to be</em> broken bolt. (This doesn't make sense, so the adjectival participle phrase is part of the direct object.)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;">The mechanic found the bolt <em>to be</em> broken. (This makes sense, which means <em>broken</em> is an object complement here.)</dd>
                        <dt>Dangling Participle</dt>
                        <dd>A <em>dangling participle</em> is a verb without a subject.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Having seen the new cars at the dealership, the new vehicle was the best choice.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: -15px;">(Here, the "new vehicle" isn't doing the seeing.)</dd>
                        <dd>A source of dangling participles is that the sentence has a <em>delayed subject</em>. There are two common reasons for these delayed subjects:</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <ol>
                                <li><em>There transformations</em> (<a href="#theretransform">Chapter 5</a>)</li>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                        <li>Having left the car on all night, there was no more gas.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><em>Anticipatory it</em> (<a href="#Chapter9">Chapter 9</a>)</li>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                        <li>Working hard on painting the walls in my office, it was nice of you to bring me some lunch.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </ol>
                        </dd>
                        <dd>To fix this, it does not help to move the dangling participle phrase to the end of the sentence.</dd>
                        <dd>The best way to fix delayed subjects to revise the sentence and expand the participle phrase into a complete clause.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>After we left the car on all night</u>, there was no more gas.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;">It was nice of you to bring me some lunch <u>when you knew I was working hard</u> on painting the walls in my office.</dd>
                        <dd>Another issue that can cause dangling participles is passive voice.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Having been working on these damn notes for 13 hours, the notes had still not been completed before the final exam.</dd>
                        <dd>The problem with the passive voice is that the missing agent for the verb "completed." Adjusting the sentence to be active voice will fix the issue:</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Having been working on these damn notes for 13 hours, <u><em>I</em> still have not completed the notes before the final exam</u>.</dd>
                        <dt>Participles as Adverbials or Adjectivals</dt>
                        <dd>Some participle phrases have characteristics of both adjectivals and adverbials.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;"><u>Walking in the blizzard</u>, Pete got really cold.</dd>
                        <dd>The opening verb phrase can be expanded into an adjectival or an adverbial.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Pete, <u>who was walking in the blizzard</u>, got really cold. (adjectival participle phrase)</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px; margin-top: -15px;"><u>While he was walking in the blizzard</u>, Pete got really cold. (adverbial participle phrase - see <a href="#verbphrases">Chapter 6</a>)</dd>

                <h3>Punctuation of Clauses and Participles</h3>
                    <p>When figuring out punctuation for clauses and participles, one needs to question if it is a <strong><em>restrictive modifier</em></strong> or <strong><em>nonrestrictive modifier</em></strong>. One needs to be set off by commas; one does not.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Restrictive Modifiers</dt>
                        <dd>It might be easier to think of this as a <em>defining</em> or <em>identifying</em> modifier. The question to ask is: Does this clause's information directly identify or define the noun? And is this information required? If it does directly identify or define <em>and</em> is required information, then clause is <strong><em>restrictive</em></strong> and does <em>not</em> need to be set off by commas.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">Ex: The teacher wearing a blue shirt is the math teacher.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-top: -15px;">Here, we assume that by identifying the teacher by wearing a blue shirt that they are the only one wearing a blue shirt. By saying "the teacher wearing a blue shirt," we indicate that we are specifically identifying THAT teacher.</dd>
                        <dt>Nonrestrictive Modifiers</dt>
                        <dd>For this one, it might be easier to think of these as a <em>commenting</em> modifier. The question to ask is: Does the modifier comment on (not restrict) the noun? Is the information required? If it does merely comments on the noun and is not required to identify the noun, or in other words is simply additional information, then the clause is <strong><em>nonrestrictive</em></strong> and <em>does</em> need to be set off by commas.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-left: 90px;">My sister, who is turning 22 this month, works at Pizza Hut.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-top: -15px;">The clause "who is turning 22 this month," is not required information to the sentence and merely comments extra details about my sister, which means that the clause is <strong><em>nonrestrictive</em></strong> and <em>does</em> need to be set off by commas.</dd>                        
                    </dl>
                    <p>Many times, this comes down to context, which is why determining restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses can be tricky or up to the writer to decide, as setting a clause off with commas can change the entire meaning of the sentence.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>The power went out during the thunderstorm. All of my family members <u>who were more adventurous than I</u> went outside and got wet. I stayed inside, wrapped up in a blanket.</dd>
                        <dd style="margin-top: -10px;">The power went out during the thunderstorm. All of myy family members, <u>who were more adventurous than I</u>, went outside and got wet. I stayed inside, wrapped up in a blanket.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>The first sentence suggests that <em>all</em> of the family members went out side and got wet. Whereas the second sentence suggests that <em>only</em> the family members who were more adventurous went outside and got wet. </p>
                    <!-- <p>In the case of <strong><em>Relative clauses</em></strong>, the relative pronoun provides some clues for punctuation:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li></li>
                    </ol>
