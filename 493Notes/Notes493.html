                    "There is no one correct or proper version of the English language: There are many. Even the version we call American English has a wide variety of <em>dialects</em>. Different parts of the country, different levels of education, different ethnic backgrounds, different settlement histories--these factors produce differences in language communities. Every variety of English is equally grammatical--equally systematic, complex, logical, and exspressive" (p. 4).

                                It's important to recognize that these internalized rules vary from one language community to another. (For example, plural "you." Some say 'you or you all' and others say 'y'all.)
                            </li>

                    <a id="Inflectional_Affix_Notes"></a>Inflectional affixes are morphemes that are added to the open classes to change their grammatical rule in some way.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nouns have two inflectional affixes. (-s and -'s)</li>
                        <li>Verbs have four inflectional affixes (-s, -ing, -en, -ed)</li>
                        <li>Adjectives (and sometimes adverbs) have -er and -est.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                </p>

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <a id="Verb_forms"></a>
                    A verb has three base forms (ex. to laugh):<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Base form (infinitive) [to laugh]</li>
                            <li class="tab">Past tense [laughed] -ed</li>
                            <li class="tab">Past participle [laughed] -en</li>
                            <li>-s form [laughs]</li>
                            <li>-ing form [laughing]</li>
                        </ul>
                    Base, past tense, and past participle are principle parts.<br>
                    There are two types of verbs: <b>Transitive</b> and <b>Intransitive</b> verbs.<br>

                </p>
                
                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                    <a id="Noun_notes"</a></a>
                    Pronouns are considered nouns.<br>
                    A, an, and the are articles / determiners.<br>
                    Proper nouns, pronouns, and plurals don't have determiners.<br>
                    Objects are always nouns.<br>
                    An article is always a determiner but a determiner is not always an article.<br>
                    <br>NP + NP = sentence<br>
                    Ex. he eats. I ran.
                </p>

                <p class="break">

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Adjectives and adverbs can udually be cognized by their form and/or position in the sentences.<br>
                    Comparative and suplerative forms (-er and -est) sometimes dont follow the inflectional endings. (i.e. more/most, less/least)<br>
                    Intensifier (very)<br>
                    Adverbs are more moveable within a sentence, whereas adjectives are found near the item they are describing.<br>
                    Adverbs often end in -ly, but this is not an infectional ending; it is derivational.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Adverbs supply information about time, place, manner, and frequency.<br>
                    Adverbs answer such questions as: <u>when</u>, <u>where</u>, <u>why</u>, <u>how</u>, and <u>how often</u>.*
                    </em> (These are also know as <b><em>Adverbials</em></b>.)<br>
                    <em>Adjectives answer questions like: <u>which one</u>, <u>what kind of</u>, and <u>what color</u>.</em> (These are also known as <em><b>Adjectivals</b></em>.)<br>
                    <br>*In language classes, when a word is underlined, we mean it as a word not as part of a sentence.

                    <dd>The ADV will be in a prepositional form describing where or when, like "We are <span class="ADV"><u>in the swimming pool</u> <u>on Friday</u></span>." (Here we actually have both time and place in one sentece.)</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Pattern II: <span class="NP">NP</span> + <span class="verb">be</span> + <span class="ADJ">ADJ</span></dt>
                    <dd>NP (subject) + be (predicating verb) + ADJ (subject complement) </dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The Internet connection</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADJ">decent</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The ADJ here acts as a subject complement. </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Pattern III: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">be</span> + <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + be (predicating verb) + NP<sub>I</sub> (subject complement) </dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The kid</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="NP">a troublemaker</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The multiple NP<sub>I</sub>s in Pattern III indicate that the two noun phrases have the same referent. The <em>be</em> verb acts like an equal sign.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern IV: <span class="NP">NP</span> + <span class="verb">V-lnk</span> + <span class="ADJ">ADJ</span></dt>
                    <dd>NP (subject) + linking verb + ADJ (subject complement)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The soup</span> <span class="verb">tastes</span> <span class="ADJ">salty</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>Pattern IV is a common category for verbs of the senses. <br>The way to recognize linking verbs is to understand the role of the subject complement, to recognize the form of the structure following the verb and its relation to the subject.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern V: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub> + <span class="verb">V-link</span> + <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span></dt>

                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The kid</span> <span class="verb">became</span> <span class="NP">a troublemaker.</span> </dd>
                    <dd>Very few linking verbs will fit this pattern, as most of them take adjectivals. <em>Become</em> and <em>remain</em> are the most common linking verbs found for Pattern V.</dd>
                </dl>
                
            <h3>Optional Slots</h3>
                <p>The <em>optional slot</em> is an adverbial slot that can appear in every sentence pattern. Every sentence has its requirements to be a complete sentence, but most sentences often include information beyond that.</p>
                <p>Some examples of each pattern with the optional ADV slot:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pattern I: <span class="NP">I</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADV"><u>in the library</u> <u>at 2:30 pm</u></span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern II: <span class="ADV"><u>Yesterday</u></span>, <span class="NP"> the COVID risk meter</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADJ">yellow</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern III: <span class="NP">Paul</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="NP">a magician</span> <span class="ADV"><u>on the weekends</u></span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern IV: <span class="NP">The band</span> <span class="ADV"><u>always</u></span> <span class="verb">sounds</span> <span class="ADJ">good</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern V: <span class="NP">The book</span> <span class="verb">remains</span> <span class="NP">a classic</span> <span class="prep">with the students</span> <span class="ADV"><u>in the CAL program</u></span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You get the point. We can add an optional ADV slot just about anywhere in any pattern, and we can add as many as we want. We can also do this with Pattern VI through Pattern X (39).</p>

                    <dd>NP (subject) + Intransitive Verb</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">Sylvia</span> <span class="verb">slept</span> <span class="ADV">on the bus</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>Intransive verbs do not have a compliment following the verb.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern VII: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (direct object)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The quarterback</span> <span class="verb">threw</span> <span class="obj">the football</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>When there is a reflexive pronoun (ex. <em>myself</em>) or a reciprocal pronoun (ex. <em>each other</em>), the direct object actually will have the same NP<sub>I</sub> as the subject, <br>instead of NP<sub>II</sub> because the subject and object refer to the same thing. This falls under this pattern because how the verb works here. </dd>

                    <dt>Pattern VIII: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span  class="obj"><u>NP</u><sub>II</sub></span> + <span class="objio"">NP<sub>III</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (<u>indirect object</u>) + NP<sub>III</sub> (direct object) <br>*I will be underlining the <u>indirect object</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">Brenda's father</span> <span class="verb">bought</span> <span class="obj"><u>her</u></span> <span class="objio"> a car</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The direct object and indirect object slots can be switched as well: <br>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (direct object) + NP<sub>III</sub> (<u>indirect object</u>)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">Jeremy</span> <span class="verb">gave</span> <span class="obj">his homework</span> <span class="objio"><u>to the professor</u></span>.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern IX: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span> + <span class="ADJ"">ADJ</span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (direct object) + ADJ (object complement)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The employees</span> <span class="verb">consider</span> <span class="obj">the job</span> <span class="ADJ">difficult</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>Verbs commonly found in this pattern are <em>prefer, like, consider, make,</em> and <em>find</em>.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern X: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span> + <span class="obj"><u>NP</u><sub>II</sub></span></dt>

                    <dd>The possibility of inserting the words <em>to be</em> between the direct object and the following slot can serve as a test for Patterns IX and X. If <em>to be</em> is possible, then what follows is an object complement.</dd>

            <h2>Chapter 5: Changing Sentence Focus</h2>
            <h3>Passive Voice</h3>
                <dt>There are three indicators to determine a secntence is passive:</dt>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An object, usually the direct object, becomes the subject.</li>
                        <li>A form of <em>be</em> is added as an auxilary; it teams with the past participle, the <em>-en</em> form of the verb. In other words, we add <em>be</em> + <em>-en</em> to the active verb string.</li>
                        <li>The original agent (subject), if mentioned, becomes the object of the preposition <em>by</em>. This third step is often missing; it is not required. Most passive sentences do not include the active agent.</li>
                    </ol>
                <dd>Ex (active): Ms. Franklin created the test.</dd>
                <dd>Ex (passive): The test was created by Ms. Franklin.</dd> 
                <dt>Changing Passive Voice to Active</dt>
                <dd>There are three steps that "undo" the three indicators above that make a sentence passive:</dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify the agent or true subject or "doer" of the verbal action. If the agent is named, you'll usually find it in a <em>by</em> preposistional phrase. If a <em>by</em> preposistional phrase or agent, just add "someone."</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A surprise party is being set up by his wife. [Agent: his wife]</li>
                                <li>The homework should be finished by Tuesday. [Agent: someone]</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Next, delete <em>be</em> + <em>-en</em> from the verb string.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>is being set up = pres + be + ing + <strike>be</strike> + <strike>-en</strike> + set up</li>
                                <li>needs to be finished = past + shall + <strike>be</strike> + <strike>-en</strike> + finish</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Rewrite the sentence with the agent in the subject prosition, the revised verb in place, and the passive subject shifted to the direct object slot.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>His wife is setting up a surpise party.</li>
                                <li>Someone should finish the homework by Tuesday.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
                <h3 style="font-size: smaller;">Passive Voice or Active Voice?</h3>
                    <p>Passive voice is oftentimes seen as negative. This is due to passive sentences sometimes having a vague or unnatural quality, which can usually be improved by being changed to active voice. Though in most cases, this is because of a problem elsewhere in the sentence, not necessarily passive voice itself. The issue could lie in the fact that the focus of the sentence is off, which can cause the sentence to be in poor quality.</p>
                    <p>"<em>The main job of passive voice is to provide cohesion.</em> The passive voice enables the writer to shift emphasis in the sentene so that the reader will put the focus where it should be&#8212;on the new information" (93).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is also used when the "identity of the agent is obscured in history or simply has no bearing on the discussion" (93).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is common and encouraged in technical and scientific writing, legal documents, and lab reports, where the researcher is the agent. For example, "I added 10ml water to the solution every 10 minutes" is active but unnecissarily includes the researcher, so "Ten millileters Water was added to the solution every 10 minutes" would be more appropriate but is passive.</p>
                    <p>Some cases of passive voice just are more direct than active. For example, "Joe was sent to Iraq" (94).</p>
                    <p>Passive voice is used in "official-ese" or "bureaucrat-ese" to disguise or avoid the agent all together so the reader or audience does not know who is responsible. For example:<br> <br>"It was noted in today's expense reports that there will be budget cuts and some employees will be terminated. Severence packages have been estabilished for those being let go. There are options to find a new position within the company."<br> <br>In this example, there is no agent mentioned. We don't know who "noted, cutting the budget, terminating employees, or established." This is often used when someone does not want to mention or reveal "who" was responsible for something.</p>
                <h3>The <em>There</em> Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The <em>there transformation</em> provides the writer a way of changing sentence focus by altering the word order by opnening the sentence with the undtressed <em>there</em>, known as an <em>expletive</em>.</p>
                    <p>The <em>there transformation</em> applies when the subject of the sentence is indefinite: "a book" or "an apple" rather than "the book" or "the apple."<br>The <em>indefinite article</em> is the signal that the subject of the <em>there transformation</em> is new information; we use the <em>definite article</em> for old or known information.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt style="text-indent: 50px;">There's a book on vegan baking on the shelf.</dt>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">When reading this sentence out loud, there is no stress on the "there" but rather there's stress on "book,"" as it is the focal point of the sentence.</dd>
                        <dt style="text-indent: 50px;">There's the book on vegan baking.</dt>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">This time, because the specific book is known, the stress is on "there" this time rather than "book".</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>The <em>expletive</em> form of there is <em>always unstressed</em>.</p>
                    <p>The <em>adverb</em> form of there, when opening a sentence, is <em>nearly always stressed</em>. This one acts like a pointer. "It's THAT specific thing."</p>
                <h3>Cleft Sentences</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Cleft Sentences</dt>
                        <dd>Allow writers to accomplish by means of word order what a speaker can do by varying the point of the main stress or loudness.</dd>
                        <dd>SHARON gave a speech on Civil Rights on Friday. (It wasn't Jacob.)<br>Sharon gave a SPEECH on Civil Rights on Friday. (It wasn't a slideshow.)<br>Sharon gave a speech on CIVIL RIGHTS on Friday. (It wasn't on the Holocaust.)<br>Sharon gave a speech on Civil Right on FRIDAY. (Not on Thursday.)</dd>
                        <dd>Each of these show the stress that can be placed throughout the same sentence while speaking, though writing does not call for all-caps like this. This is where two types of clefts come in:</dd>
                        <dt style="text-indent: 50px;">It-cleft</dt>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">With it-clefts, you'll notice that the phrase following <em>was</em> is stressed, like the all-caps in the previous set of sentences do.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px;">It was <u>Sharon</u> who gave a speech on Civil Rights on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px; margin-top: -20px;">It was a <u>speech</u> that Sharon gave on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px; margin-top: -20px;">It was <u>Civil Rights</u> that Sharon gave a speech on, on Friday.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px; margin-top: -20px;">It was <u>Friday</u> Sharon gave a speech on Civil Rights.</dd>
                        <dt style="text-indent: 50px;">What-Cleft</dt>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">With what-clefts, a <em>what</em> clause is put in the subject position, and <em>was</em> separates the original sentence into two parts.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px;">What Sharon gave <u>was</u> a speech.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">Sometimes <em>what</em> shifts the original verb phrase into subject position. Again, a form of <em>be</em> is added as the main verb.</dd>
                        <dd style="text-indent: 100px;"><u>What scared me most as a child</u> was the dark.</dd>

            <h3>Modifiers of the Verb: Adverbials</h3>
            <h3>The Moveable Adverbials</h3>
                <p>In the following sentence, there are three underlines structures&ndash;an adverb, a prepositional phrase, and a clause&ndash;wach of which add adverbial information to the verd <em>sang</em>:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang  <u>angelically</u>  <u>within the church sanctuary</u>  <u>when the organ began to play</u>.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>How?</em>) angelically.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>Where?</em>) within the church sanctuary.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The choir boy sang (<em>When?</em>) when the organ began to play.</p>
                <p>Even though all the adbervials in the prior sentence follow the verb, there is no fixed spot for most adverbials, which is why <em>moveability</em> is one of the most telling characteristics of Adverbials. For example:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the organ began to play, the choir boy sang angelically within the church sanctuary.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 100px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Within the church sanctuary, the choir boy sang angelically when the organ began to play.</p>
                <p>"The position may depend on the writer's emphasis, the rhythm of the sentence, its relation to the previous sentence, or simply on the desire for sentence variety" (109).</p>
            <h3>Adverbs</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Adverbs of Manner</dt>
                    <dd style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>-ly</em> words, such as lovely, angrily, sadly, and usually tell "how" or in "what manner." For example: She spoke softly   =   in a soft manner</dd>
                    <dd>Manner adverbs such as these are the most moveable adverbials, as they can appear before or after the verb or at the beginning or end of the sentence.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;"><u>Slowly</u>, the old lady ate her oatmeal.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">The old lady <u>slowly</u> ate her oatmeal.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">The old lady ate <u>slowly</u>.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">The old lady ate her oatmeal <u>slowly</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>A single-word adverb can even come within the verb strong, between and auxilary word and the main verb:</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">The car was <u>immediately</u> turned over to the police as evidence.</dd>
                    <dd>Or between auxilaries:</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">I have <u>suddenly</u> been stuck with anxiety.</dd>
                    <dd>Furthermore, manner verbs can be marked by <em>qualifiers</em>, words such as <em>very, quite, so, rather</em>.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">I <u>very softly</u> walked through the house.</dd>
                    <dd>And like the adjectives they come from, these adverbs can be made comparative or superlative by adding <em>more</em> or <em>most</em>.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">Dr. Carollo reads his poetry out load <u>most articulately</u>.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>Single-word Adverbs</dt>
                    <dd>Besides the <em>-ly</em> adverbs, many other single-word adverbs provide information of time, place, frequency, and the like, including, but not limited to: <em>now, then, nowadays, today, often, always, sometimes, seldom, never, here, there, everywhere.</em></dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">You <u>seldom</u> do laundry during the week.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;"><u>Never</u> have I seen her <u>here</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>Some of these can be compared or qualified.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;">I ate <u>too fast</u>.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px;"><u>Quite often</u>, I oversleep on weekends.</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>Prepositional Phrases</h3>
                <p>Prepositional phrases are one of the most common modifying structures, appearing regularly as noun and verb modifiers.</p>
                <p>Common prepositions include: <em>above, across, against, along, among, around, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, by, down, from, in, into, near, of, off, on, to, toward, under, upon, with</em> and <em>within</em>.</p>
                <p>Some prepositional phrases have modifiers that qualify or intesify them:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">James sat down <u>quickly</u> in his desk.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mr. White cried <u>softly</u> into his pillow.</p>
                <p>Sentences often have more than one adverbial prepositional phrase:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Santiago ran <u>to his mother's house</u>  <u>in the rain</u>  <u>on Sunday morning</u>.</p>
                <p>Like adverbs, adverbial prepositional phrases are rather moveable, but those referring to time tend to be more moveable than those referring to place, especially when found in the same sentence.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Around 9 AM</u>  <u>on Tuesday</u>,  the building caught on fire  <u>in the city</u>.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-top: -15px;"><u>In the city</u>,  the building caught on fire  <u>on Tuesday</u>  <u>around 9 AM</u>.</p>
                <p>Prepositional phrases can modify nouns as well as verbs, which can cause or <em>ambiguity</em>. For example:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">He is going to eat the the spaghetti on the floor. This can be understood as:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">He is going to eat the spaghetti that has fallen on the floor/eating it off the floor</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">He is going to eat his spaghetti dinner while sitting on the floor.</p>
            <h3>Nouns and Noun Phrases</h3>
                <p>"Nouns and noun phrases that function adverbially from a fairly short list designating time, place, manner, and quantity" (114). For example:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">He went <u>south</u>. (place)</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">I ate breakfast <u>this morning</u>. (time)</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">Paul lifted <u>100 pounds</u> at the gym. (quantity)</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">She flew <u>first-class</u>. (manner)</p>
            <h3>Verb Phrases</h3>
                <p>"The most common form in an adverbial role is the <em>infinitive</em>" (117). This is the same as an <em>infinitive phrase</em>.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Molly drove her car <u>to bring her sister to school</u>.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">Wilson paid <u>to provide his little brother lunch</u>.</p>
                <p>As an added trick to see if the infinitive is working as a an adverbial verb phrase, replace the "to" in the infinitive phrase to "in order to." If this works, the infinitive is acting as an adverbial infinitive phrase.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Molly drove her car <u><strong>in order to</strong> bring her sister to school</u>.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">Wilson paid <u><strong>in order to</strong> provide his little brother lunch</u>.</p>
                <p><em>Dangling infinitives</em> occur when the subject of the sentence is no longer the subject of the adverbial infinitive phrase or is absent.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><u>To keep the employees happy</u>, good incentives are needed.</p>
                <p>This sentence does not have uncertain or unclear meaning, and the reader will not have difficulty understanding. But there is a sense of ambiguity that can be cleared up with the addition of the subject.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><u>A manager</u> need good incentives <u>to keep employees happy</u>.</p>
                <p>Sometimes <a href="#participles">participles and participle phrases</a> can have an adverbial funciton, providing information of time, place, reason, and manner, as other adverbials do:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The couple fought <u>screaming at each other</u>.</p>
            <h3>Clauses</h3>
                <p>All sentences and <a href="#patterns">the patterns listed in Chatper 3</a> are considered clause, but not all clauses are sentences!</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Dependent Clause (Subordinate Clause)</dt>
                    <dd>Any clause that is not a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dt>Independent Clause (Main Clause)</dt>
                    <dd>Any clause that is a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>When the train came to a halt</u>,  <u>the tourists stumbled</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>"When the train came to a halt" is a dependent clause as it is an adverbial phrase.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -15px;">"The tourists stumbled" is an independent clause because it is a complete sentence on its own.</dd>
                    <dt>Complex Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>Any sentence that includes a dependent clause of any kind.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Because there's a chance for rain</u>,  <u>I packed rainboots and a jacket.</u></dd>
                    <dd>"Because there's a chance of rain" is a dependent clause as it begins with the subordinating conjunction, <em>because</em>.'</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -15px;">"I packed rainboots and a jacket" is an independent clause.</dd>
                    <dt>Compound Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>A sentence with two or more independent clauses.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Mark really enjoyed dinner</u>;  <u>he ate everything on his plate.</u></dd>
                    <dd>Both "Mark really enjoyed dinner" and "he ate everything on his plate," are independent clauses and can stand alone, but since they are connected with a semi-colon, this because a compound sentence.</dd>
                    <dt>Compound-Complex Sentence</dt>
                    <dd>A sentence with a dependent clause and more than one independent clause.</dd>
                    <dd style="text-indent: 50px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><u>Since it was cold outside</u>,  <u>the dog slept next to the fireplace</u>,  <u>and the fire crackled through the night</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>"Since it was cold outside" is a dependent clause because it starts with a subordinating conjunction.</dd>
                    <dd style="margin-top: -15px;">"The dog slept next to the fireplace" and "the fire crackled through the night" are both independent clauses.</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>Punctuation of Adverbials</h3>
                <p>Some opening adverbials are set off by commas while some are not. The use of these commas tend to be stylistic choice, especially when it comes to phrases. Generally a short prepositional phrase or noun phrase or an adverb will not be set off:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Quickly they all sprinted to the storm shelter.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: -15px;">Around 7AM the birds began to chirp.</p>
                <p>With longer prepositional phrases, there is a choice:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">On sunday morning after church the family goes to brunch.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">At the elementary school during the flood, volunteers made lunches for the displaced and homeless.</p>
                <p>When the end of the adverbial slot is not readily apparent, the comma will help any misunderstanding:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the summer, nights come with a cool breeze.</p>
                <p>Verb phrases and clauses are <em>always</em> set off by commas:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">To become a teacher, I had to read many books for class and independently.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">To rollerskate, you have to have great balance.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">When the moon is out, wolves begin to howl.</p>
                <p>When an adverbial interrupts the verb phrase for special effective, it will be set off by commas:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The telemarketer, annoyingly, called me twice during dinner.</p>
                <p>When the opening phrase is parenthetical, or clearly a comment on the whole sentence than a typical adverbial, then a comma is requested:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly" (The Bee Movie, 2007).</p>
