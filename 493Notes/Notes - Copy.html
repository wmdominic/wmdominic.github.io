                    "There is no one correct or proper version of the English language: There are many. Even the version we call American English has a wide variety of <em>dialects</em>. Different parts of the country, different levels of education, different ethnic backgrounds, different settlement histories--these factors produce differences in language communities. Every variety of English is equally grammatical--equally systematic, complex, logical, and exspressive" (p. 4).

                                It's important to recognize that these internalized rules vary from one language community to another. (For example, plural "you." Some say 'you or you all' and others say 'y'all.)

                    <a id="Inflectional_Affix_Notes"></a>Inflectional affixes are morphemes that are added to the open classes to change their grammatical rule in some way.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nouns have two inflectional affixes. (-s and -'s)</li>
                        <li>Verbs have four inflectional affixes (-s, -ing, -en, -ed)</li>
                        <li>Adjectives (and sometimes adverbs) have -er and -est.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                </p>
                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <a id="Verb_forms"></a>
                    A verb has three base forms (ex. to laugh):<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Base form (infinitive) [to laugh]</li>
                            <li class="tab">Past tense [laughed] -ed</li>
                            <li class="tab">Past participle [laughed] -en</li>
                            <li>-s form [laughs]</li>
                            <li>-ing form [laughing]</li>
                        </ul>
                    Base, past tense, and past participle are principle parts.<br>
                    There are two types of verbs: <b>Transitive</b> and <b>Intransitive</b> verbs.<br>

                </p>
                
                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                    <a id="Noun_notes"</a></a>
                    Pronouns are considered nouns.<br>
                    A, an, and the are articles / determiners.<br>
                    Proper nouns, pronouns, and plurals don't have determiners.<br>
                    Objects are always nouns.<br>
                    An article is always a determiner but a determiner is not always an article.<br>
                    <br>NP + NP = sentence<br>
                    Ex. he eats. I ran.
                </p>

                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Adjectives and adverbs can udually be cognized by their form and/or position in the sentences.<br>
                    Comparative and suplerative forms (-er and -est) sometimes dont follow the inflectional endings. (i.e. more/most, less/least)<br>
                    Intensifier (very)<br>
                    Adverbs are more moveable within a sentence, whereas adjectives are found near the item they are describing.<br>
                    Adverbs often end in -ly, but this is not an infectional ending; it is derivational.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="break">
                    ~
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Adverbs supply information about time, place, manner, and frequency.<br>
                    Adverbs answer such questions as: <u>when</u>, <u>where</u>, <u>why</u>, <u>how</u>, and <u>how often</u>.*
                    </em> (These are also know as <b><em>Adverbials</em></b>.)<br>
                    <em>Adjectives answer questions like: <u>which one</u>, <u>what kind of</u>, and <u>what color</u>.</em> (These are also known as <em><b>Adjectivals</b></em>.)<br>
                    <br>*In language classes, when a word is underlined, we mean it as a word not as part of a sentence.

                    <dd>Direct object has a referent different than the subject, as indicated with the subscript II. Think of the the subject as the <em>doer</em> and the object as the <em>receiver</em>.

                    <dd>NP (subject) + be (predicating verb) + ADV (adverbial of time or place)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The students</span> <span class="verb">are</span> <span class="ADV">upstairs</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The ADV will be in a prepositional form describing where or when, like "We are <span class="ADV"><u>in the swimming pool</u> <u>on Friday</u></span>." (Here we actually have both time and place in one sentece.)</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Pattern II: <span class="NP">NP</span> + <span class="verb">be</span> + <span class="ADJ">ADJ</span></dt>
                    <dd>NP (subject) + be (predicating verb) + ADJ (subject complement) </dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The Internet connection</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADJ">decent</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The ADJ here acts as a subject complement. </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Pattern III: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">be</span> + <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + be (predicating verb) + NP<sub>I</sub> (subject complement) </dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The kid</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="NP">a troublemaker</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The multiple NP<sub>I</sub>s in Pattern III indicate that the two noun phrases have the same referent. The <em>be</em> verb acts like an equal sign.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern IV: <span class="NP">NP</span> + <span class="verb">V-lnk</span> + <span class="ADJ">ADJ</span></dt>
                    <dd>NP (subject) + linking verb + ADJ (subject complement)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The soup</span> <span class="verb">tastes</span> <span class="ADJ">salty</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>Pattern IV is a common category for verbs of the senses. <br>The way to recognize linking verbs is to understand the role of the subject complement, to recognize the form of the structure following the verb and its relation to the subject.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern V: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub> + <span class="verb">V-link</span> + <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + linking verb + NP<sub>I</sub> (subject complement)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The kid</span> <span class="verb">became</span> <span class="NP">a troublemaker.</span> </dd>
                    <dd>Very few linking verbs will fit this pattern, as most of them take adjectivals. <em>Become</em> and <em>remain</em> are the most common linking verbs found for Pattern V.</dd>
                </dl>
                
            <h3>Optional Slots</h3>
                <p>The <em>optional slot</em> is an adverbial slot that can appear in every sentence pattern. Every sentence has its requirements to be a complete sentence, but most sentences often include information beyond that.</p>
                <p>Some examples of each pattern with the optional ADV slot:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pattern I: <span class="NP">I</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADV"><u>in the library</u> <u>at 2:30 pm</u></span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern II: <span class="ADV"><u>Yesterday</u></span>, <span class="NP"> the COVID risk meter</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="ADJ">yellow</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern III: <span class="NP">Paul</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="NP">a magician</span> <span class="ADV"><u>on the weekends</u></span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern IV: <span class="NP">The band</span> <span class="ADV"><u>always</u></span> <span class="verb">sounds</span> <span class="ADJ">good</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Pattern V: <span class="NP">The book</span> <span class="verb">remains</span> <span class="NP">a classic</span> <span class="prep">with the students</span> <span class="ADV"><u>in the CAL program</u></span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You get the point. We can add an optional ADV slot just about anywhere in any pattern, and we can add as many as we want. We can also do this with Pattern VI through Pattern X (39).</p>

                    <dd>Intransive verbs do not have a compliment following the verb.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern VII: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (direct object)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">The quarterback</span> <span class="verb">threw</span> <span class="obj">the football</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>When there is a reflexive pronoun (ex. <em>myself</em>) or a reciprocal pronoun (ex. <em>each other</em>), the direct object actually will have the same NP<sub>I</sub> as the subject, instead of NP<sub>II</sub> because the subject and object refer to the same thing. This falls under this pattern because how the verb works here. </dd>

                    <dt>Pattern VIII: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span  class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span> + <span class="objio"">NP<sub>III</sub></span></dt>
                    <dd>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (<u>indirect object</u>) + NP<sub>III</sub> (direct object) <br>*I will be underlining the <u>indirect object</u>.</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">Brenda's father</span> <span class="verb">bought</span> <span class="obj">her</span> <span class="objio"> car</span>.</dd>
                    <dd>The direct object and indirect object slots can be switched as well: <br>NP<sub>I</sub> (subject) + Transitive Verb + NP<sub>II</sub> (direct object) + NP<sub>III</sub> (<u>indirect object</u>)</dd>
                    <dd>Ex: <span class="NP">Jeremy</span> <span class="verb">gave</span> <span class="obj">his homework</span> <span class="objio">to the professor</span>.</dd>

                    <dt>Pattern IX: <span class="NP">NP<sub>I</sub></span> + <span class="verb">V-tr</span> + <span class="obj">NP<sub>II</sub></span> + <span class="ADJ"">ADJ</span></dt>
