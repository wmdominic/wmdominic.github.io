        <p>My name is William Lewandowski. I am currently finishing my second degree, a Bachelor's of Science in Communication Arts and Literature Education, at Minnesota State University Moorhead. I currently have a Bachelor of Arts in English with an emphasis in Writing. I am a published author, poet, photographer, and journalist. I love to travel and study abroad.</p>
        <p>I have always wished to be a teacher since the age of five, and the dream has never went away. Since I was young, I have always been passionate about learning, as well as teaching others to help them get to their own dreams, goals, and desires in life. As a tutor for MSUM's University Writing Center for four years, one as a writing consultant and three as head writing tutor, I was given the rewarding opportunity to assist great minds from across the globe who have come to the university to study and earn their degrees. If I can help even one person acheive what they hope for in life, I've done what I was born to do.</p>
